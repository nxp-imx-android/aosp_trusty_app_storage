 * @written_super_block_version:    Last written super block version.
 * @main_repaired:                  %true if main file system has been repaired

 *                                  Must be 16 if @dev is not tamper_detecting.
 * @reserved_count:                 Number of free blocks reserved for active
 *                                  transactions.
 * @initial_super_block_tr:         Internal transaction containing initial
