 * @BLOCK_ENTRY_DATA_LOAD_FAILED: Block data could not be loaded from the disk.
 *                                This may be caused by a transient I/O error.

 *                                    back to disk. Data must be encrypted and

 *                                    entry can be reused.
 * @BLOCK_ENTRY_DATA_DIRTY_ENCRYPTED: Block entry contains valid ciphertext data
 *                                    that has not yet been queued for write

 *                          writes to data.
 * @data:                   Decrypted block data.
 * @guard2:                 Set to BLOCK_CACHE_GUARD_2 to detect out of bound
 *                          writes to data.
 * @key:                    Key to use for encrypt, decrypt and calculate_mac.
 * @dev:                    Device that block was read from and will be written
 *                          to.
 * @block:                  Block number in dev.
 * @block_size:             Size of block, but match dev->block_size.
 * @mac:                    Last calculated mac of encrypted block data.
 * @state:                  Current state of @data, indicating if data has been
 *                          loaded from disk or written into this cache entry.
 *                          This state is reset to %BLOCK_ENTRY_INVALID when a
 *                          cache entry previously containing a different block
 *                          is selected for reuse. See &enum
 *                          block_cache_entry_state for details.
 * @encrypted:              %true if @data is currently encrypted.
 * @dirty_ref:              Data is currently being modified. Only a single
 *                          reference should be allowed.
 * @dirty_mac:              Data has been modified. Mac needs to be updated
 *                          after encrypting block.
 * @dirty_tmp:              Data can be discarded by
 *                          block_cache_discard_transaction.
 * @pinned:                 Block cannot be reused if it fails to write.
 * @is_superblock:          Block is used as a superblock and files should be
 *                          synced before it is written.
 * @dirty_tr:               Transaction that modified block.
 * @obj:                    Reference tracking struct.
 * @lru_node:               List node for tracking least recently used cache
 *                          entries.
 * @io_op_node:             List node for tracking active read and write
 *                          operations.
 * @io_op:                  Currently active io operation.
 *
 * @dirty_ref, @dirty_mac, @dirty_tmp, and @dirty_tr are only relevant if @state
 * is %BLOCK_ENTRY_DATA_DIRTY, i.e. @data has been modified and not yet queued
 * for write or discarded.
